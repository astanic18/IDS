    "Types of data labeling depend on the problem, the time frame and the number of people doing it. In-house data labeling ensures the highest quality because it is usually done by scientists or people in the organization (e. g. insurance, healthcare, etc.), but the whole process is very slow. Crowdsourcing, as another kind of data labeling, refers to the help of a large number of freelancers registered on the crowdsourcing platform and the datasets they annotate mostly consist of trivial data which does not require additional expertise (animals, plants, etc.). Outsourcing refers to trained annotators (an individual or organization) in projects that do not have a lot of funding, but require significant quality in data labeling. It is somewhere in the middle between crowdsourcing and in-house labeling."

    "IMAGE CLASIFICATION refers to adding a tag to an image. The number of unique tags in the  database is the number of classes that the model can classify. There are binary classification (consisting of only two labels) and multi-class classification (containing several labels). OBJECT DETECTION refers to detection of objects and their locations; each object is marked with its bounding box (the smallest possible rectangle around it), with the label attached to it. The coordinates of the rectangle and the corresponding label are stored in a JSON file in dictionary format where the key of the dictionary is the number or ID of the image. In IMAGE SEGMENTATION image objects are separated from their background and other objects in an image, what usually results in images of the same size as the original image, containing 1 where the object is present and 0 when not. If several objects are segmented within one image, each object will be marked on a separate channel and the sum of all channels will be the reference image."
